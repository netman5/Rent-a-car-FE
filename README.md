# Rent-a-car

## Description

In this project, we have designed a booking app where a user can rent a car. The app also presents Admin privileges where an Admin can Add and Delete cars. This is engineered using Ruby on Rails as backend and React as front end. In this repository we have the frontend. The backend can be found [here.](https://github.com/brytebee/Rent-a-car)

It is built as a requirement for the Microverse Final Capstone.
